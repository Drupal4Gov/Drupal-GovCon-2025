<Announcement 
  announcement_page_title={{ value: "New Feature Release" }}
  announcement_description={{ value: "We are excited to introduce a new feature that enhances user experience." }}
  announcement_post_date={{ label: "Post Date", value: "2025-03-12" }}
/>
```

## Props

| Prop Name                | Type     | Description |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `announcement_page_title` | object   | Contains the announcement title. Use `value` for the text. |
| `announcement_description` | object   | Contains the announcement description. Use `value` for the text. |

## Data Source
The **node template (`node--announcement.html.twig`)** populates the component using Drupal fields:
```twig
{% include '@templates/announcement/announcement.twig' with {
  announcement_title: { value: label }, 
  announcement_description: { value: content.body },
  announcement_post_date: { label: content.field_important_date['#title'], value: content.field_important_date },
} %}
```
